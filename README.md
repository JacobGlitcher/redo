# React + TypeScript + Vite
## Welcome to my React.ts project

This is a playground project where I practice and train some of the tools and techniques I use in my real-life projects

### Useful scripts
to install dependencies:
```bash
npm i
``` 
###
to run the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```
and in a different terminal tab (in order to run the local backend) 
```bash
npm run server
```
###
to format the code with eslint:
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
###
to format the code with prettier:
```bash
npm run format
```
###
to build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```
